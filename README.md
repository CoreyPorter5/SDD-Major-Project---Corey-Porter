To operate my program, the user must create an account if they have not already done so. This can be done using the create account button when that is displayed on the first menu the user sees. 

Once the user has made an account, they can log into the software using their account details. Once in the software, the user can choose to enter distances for each club by pressing the "Enter Distances" button. 
After the user has entered in all the distances for each club, they can select a Golf Course and then press the "Track My Game" button. This will present the user with a separate GUI, allowing them to pick what hole they want to track at the golf course they previously chose.

The user can then press right click to drop a green dot on their mouse location. This acts as the pin location. The user can pick up and replace this green dot using the space bar. Once the green dot has been placed, the user can draw a line from where they are teeing off to where they want the ball to go. The software will then calculate the club they should use based off of live windspeeds. This data will be displayed in the top left hand corner of each hole. 

Lastly, the user can press next hole and previous hole on the software to navigate through the selected golf course.
